# osu! Local Favorites

Store osu! beatmap favorites locally in your browser. No server-side limits, no account needed - with optional GitHub Gist backup if you want your list to follow you across devices.

## What it does

Replaces the default "Favorite" button on [osu.ppy.sh](https://osu.ppy.sh) with local browser storage. Your favorites stay on your machine (or your own private Gist, if you choose to back them up).

## How to install

### Tampermonkey Userscript

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. **[Click here to install](https://github.com/starhollow2008/osu-Local-Favorites/raw/main/osu-local-favorites.user.js)** - Tampermonkey will open the installation page automatically.

The script adds a **View Local Favorites** option in the Tampermonkey menu. Click it to open a side panel with all your favorites.

Browser Extensions
> **Heavily deprecated browser extension** 
this is behind by about 2.0.3 major releases [122 commits behind check here](https://github.com/starhollow2008/osu-Local-Favorites/compare/v3.4.2...main)
> The old browser-extension build (`manifest.json`, `content.js`, `popup.*`, `background.js`, etc.) is no longer maintained or included in this repository - only the archived v3.4.2 release below still has those files. All active development happens on the Tampermonkey userscript.

1. Download `osu-favorites-extension.zip` or `osu-favorites-extension.xpi` from the [last extension release](https://github.com/starhollow2008/osu-Local-Favorites/releases/tag/v3.4.2)
2. Unzip
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer mode
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder

For Firefox
1. Download `osu-favorites-extension.xpi` from the [last extension release](https://github.com/starhollow2008/osu-Local-Favorites/releases/tag/v3.4.2) (.xpi file)
2. To install it in Firefox go to `about:debugging` → `This Firefox` → `Load Temporary Add-on` → pick the .xpi file*(temporary - it will be removed after browser restart)*

Or clone the repo and load it directly:```git clone https://github.com/starhollow2008/LOF.git``` Then load the folder in `chrome://extensions/`.

## Side Panel Demo

Search, sort, preview, and download every favorite without leaving the panel - including per-map access to any download mirrors you've enabled.

### Settings

Everything below lives behind the ⚙ **Settings** button in the side panel header:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top"><img src="screenshots/settings_full.png" width="100%" alt="Settings panel"></td>
    <td valign="top">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup &amp; Restore</strong> - export your whole library to a JSON file, or import one back in (merges, skips duplicates)</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Gist Backup</strong> - connect a GitHub account (personal access token, <code>gist</code> scope) and back your favorites up to a Gist:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Manual or Auto</strong> - flip a switch to have every new/removed favorite pushed automatically, or trigger backups yourself with <strong>Backup now</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Private or Public</strong> - choose the Gist's visibility (GitHub doesn't allow changing this after creation, so switching creates a fresh Gist)</li>
            <li><strong>Restore from Gist</strong> - pull a backup down on a new device/browser; reconnecting also auto-detects an existing backup Gist so you don't end up with duplicates</li>
            <li><strong>Fetch from Gist</strong> - pull from any gist by pasting its ID or URL, without changing what <strong>Backup now</strong> targets. Useful on a new device before your first backup, or for grabbing someone else's shared favorites list</li>
            <li>A small status line in the panel footer always shows whether you're connected and when you last synced</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Download Mirrors</strong> - osu!'s own download link requires a real logged-in session (it 404s for guests no matter what), and some maps have downloads disabled outright. Toggle third-party mirrors - Beatconnect, NeriNyan, Sayobot, Mino - and they'll show up in the panel's <strong>Download</strong> button and as extra buttons on the beatmap page itself, styled to match osu!'s own download buttons exactly. Two more controls decide ordering (nothing is ever hidden, just reordered): <strong>Preferred video option</strong> (with video vs. no video first) and <strong>Preferred source order</strong> (official vs. mirrors first - guests always see mirrors first regardless, since Official won't work without signing in). If osu!plus is already injecting its own mirror buttons on a page, ours steps aside to avoid a duplicate row</li>
        <li><strong>Appearance</strong> - pick your own accent color (replaces the default pink everywhere: buttons, badges, toggles, the header bar), a separate <strong>Heart fill color</strong> for the favorite icon itself (independent of accent, so it stays visually distinct from osu!'s own heart), and four sliders for the cover-art play button and its dim overlay: idle opacity, idle dim, hover dim, and active opacity</li>
        <li><strong>Library Maintenance</strong> - a <strong>Re-enrich all maps</strong> button that re-fetches full metadata (tags, source, genre, language, BPM, status, cover) for every favorite from osu! itself. Useful after a data-format change, or if some fields look stale or were saved in an older/differently-cased format. Runs one map at a time (rate-limited) with a live progress bar, and can be cancelled mid-run</li>
        <li><strong>Danger Zone</strong> - remove all favorites, with a two-click confirmation</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


## If you go onto a beatmap that is favorited you will see the heart icon has changed its color

| ![Floating heart](screenshots/button.png) | ![Floating heart (favorited)](screenshots/button_active.png) |

## How it works

- Intercepts favorite button clicks on beatmap pages and listing pages
- Blocks osu!'s server-side favorite API calls (and the login redirect they'd otherwise trigger)
- Stores favorites locally via `GM_setValue`/`GM_getValue`, with an optional encrypted-in-transit backup to a GitHub Gist
- Floating heart button in the bottom-right corner of every osu! page
- A side panel (☰ from the floating heart, or **View Local Favorites** in the Tampermonkey menu) to browse, search, sort, play previews, download, and manage everything
- Periodically checks GitHub for a newer script version and shows an in-panel prompt when one's available
- Its accent(glow) and colour of the heart itself can be changed by accent and heart border/fill color

## Features

- Favorite beatmaps from detail pages or listing cards, without needing to sign in
- Search and sort favorites in the side panel (by date added, title, artist, or status)
- Inline audio previews with a progress bar, right on each card
- One-click **Open** and **Download** per map (official + any mirrors you've enabled), alongside **Remove**
- Guest download links unlocked on beatmap pages and listing cards (with & without video)
- Bulk-import your real osu! account favorites via the "Favorite all" button on a profile page
- Robust against fast scrolling and osu!'s own lazy-loaded content - a periodic background scan keeps heart states, download links, and injected buttons in sync even when a card renders between checks

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `osu-local-favorites.user.js` | The Tampermonkey userscript - this *is* the extension |
| `icons/` | Icons used in the panel header and browser toolbar |
| `screenshots/` | Images used in this README |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license |

## Limitations

- Purely local by default - favorites don't sync between devices unless you export/import or connect GitHub Gist backup
- Gist backup requires a GitHub personal access token with `gist` scope, stored locally by Tampermonkey - treat it like any other credential
- Download mirrors (Beatconnect, NeriNyan, Sayobot, Mino) are third-party services, not affiliated with or endorsed by osu! - they're off by default except Beatconnect and NeriNyan; enable/disable them in Settings
- Only works on `osu.ppy.sh` beatmap pages
- May need updates if osu! changes their page layout
